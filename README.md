## Summary

In this project I got to delv deaper in to ES6. Used classes, class instants, static methods and fields and much more. 

<br>
With the new year approaching, I'd like to expand my profile which describes my programming skills to include wider and diverse capabilities. Ultimately, my goal is to land a job which incorporates these multiple skills. I would also like to demonstrate my abilities and wide knowledge of the craft. 
Therefore, I have begun revising the site and adding apps to my GitHub repository. 
<br>
This is the second project in a series of many more to come where I'll provide recruiters and employers the opportunity to go over my code in a coherent and concise manner. I plan to build a comprehensive website, impress the viewer, enhance my skills and most importantly do what I love most, coding.
