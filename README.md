## Summary

In this project I got to delve deaper in to ES6. Used classes, class instants, static methods and fields and much more. 

With the new year approaching, I'd like to expand my profile which describes my programming skills to include wider and diverse capabilities. Ultimately, my goal is to land a job which incorporates these multiple skills. I would also like to demonstrate my abilities and wide knowledge of the craft. 
Therefore, I have begun revising the site and adding apps to my GitHub repository. 

This is the second project in a series of many more to come where I'll provide recruiters and employers the opportunity to go over my code in a coherent and concise manner. I plan to build a comprehensive website, impress the viewer, enhance my skills and most importantly do what I love most,coding.
